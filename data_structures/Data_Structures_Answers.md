Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
* O(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
* O(1) the method its self doesn't actually create anything. 

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
* O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
* O(n). i'm creating a list that will expand based on the size of the input. i could grow by 2 then reduce by 1 on every loop.

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
* O(n log(n))

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
* i think if it wasn't returning an array, it would be O(1)
